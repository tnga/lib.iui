The recommended way to install **iUI** is through **Bower**. To install [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), see the [Bower web site](http://bower.io/).\r\n\r\n    Bower removes the hassle of dependency management when developing or consuming elements. When you install a component, Bower makes sure any dependencies are installed as well. So in the root of your project, just do:\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ bower install iui\r\n    ```\r\n    Bower adds a `bower_components/` folder in your root's project where the libraries will be installed.\r\n\r\n    When a new version of **iJS** is available, run bower update in your app directory to update your copy:\r\n    ```sh\r\n    $ bower update\r\n    ```   \r\n    Therefore, you use the library by include it to your project. Commonly:\r\n    ```html\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"bower_components/iui/iui.min.css\"></link>\r\n    ```\r\n2. [Download the code](https://github.com/tnga/lib.iui/archive/master.zip) and follow instructions.\r\n    - The minify code is sufficient to include it to your project.\r\n    - Read the documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nTo contribute, note that all the development features are done in `src/` directory.\r\nFunctionalities are grouped depending of what is added. \r\nWhen new group feature's file is created, it have to be specified in `./gulpfile.js` script.\r\n\r\n`gulp build` command have to be use to build the library for browser side usage. \r\nTake it a look of `./gulpfile.js` for more informations.\r\n\r\nAlso note that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) have to be installed and also [npm](https://npmjs.com) library's associated dependencies.\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) (December)-2015 -> (January)-2016 [Tindo Ngoufo Arsel](mailto:devtnga@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nThe LGPL version 2.1 or later.
